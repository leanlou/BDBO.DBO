Swarm Intelligence Optimization Algorithm:
Original algorithm: Dung Beetle Optimization (DBO)
Improved algorithms: Balanced Dung Beetle Optimization (BDBO) and Gaussian Dung Beetle Optimization (GDBO).
The contents of the file are algorithm encapsulation functions, which can be directly called by referring to the running parameter Settings of the main file.
Among them, GDBO is better than LSHADE in the application effect of engineering application problems.
